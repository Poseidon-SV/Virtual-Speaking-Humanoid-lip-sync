# Virtual Speaking Humanoid (lip-sync)

This tool can convert your written text or given audio file (.wav) to speaking virtual human animation video.

You can change the human face by going in the `face` folder and adding your own custom face but keep in mind the name and the lip position of the images.

If not given any audio or text then it will take the default audio and convert it into speach.

Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all the necessary packages, then run `main.py` to run the application.
